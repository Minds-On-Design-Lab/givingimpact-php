## Docs

Keep in mind, the Giving Impact API Library uses a fluent interface, so you can easily chain your methods together.

### Common

For a full list of all Campaign, Opportunity, Donation or Stat properties, please refer to the [API Documentation](http://givingimpact.com/docs).

Campaigns, Opportunities, Donations and Shares all share the following methods

**limit(int limit)**

Limit the number of results returned

    $campaigns = $gi->campaign
        ->limit(5);

**offset(int offset)**

Skip a number of records, useful in combination with `limit` for pagination

    $campaigns = $gi->campaign
        ->limit(10)
        ->offset(5);

**sort(string sort_by)**

Sort the returned results. By default will sort by the provided property ascending. You can change the sort direction by appending `|desc` to the end of the property.

    $campaigns = $gi->campaign
        ->sort('created_at');  // Sorts by created time ASCENDING

    $campaigns = $gi->campaign
        ->sort('created_at|desc'); // Sorts by created time DESCENDING

**status(boolean stats)**

Get only campaigns/opportunites of a particular status. By default the API returns only items with a status of `active`. Can be `active`, `inactive` or `both`.

    $campaigns = $gi->campaign
        ->status('active');

**fetch([string token])**

This is the last method you call in any query. This tells the library to construct the full URI and query the API. Once you call this method all the other filters will be reset.

    $campaigns = $gi->campaign
        ->status('both')
        ->limit(10)
        ->fetch();

    foreach( $campaigns as $campaign ) {
        echo $campaign->title;
    }

Passing a Campaign, Opportunity or Donation token (depending on the model) will return a specific campaign, opportunity or donation.

    $campaign = $gi->campaign
        ->fetch('123456');

    $donation = $gi->donation
        ->fetch('987654');

## Custom Checkout for Donations

This approach gives you incredible flexibility to integrate checkout into your online fundraising experience. There are a collection of requirements to enable your checkout form as detailed below; however, how you build and integrate your form is up to you. In collaboration with our payment processor, Stripe.com, there is a particular setup for credit card processing which ensure consistency of security with our hosted option and in line with Stripe’s requirements that in turn greatly lesson the security compliance burden for you.

In short, this setup ensures that credit card data does not touch your server (let alone Giving Impact’s) on its way to Stripe.com.


* cc_number **required**, valid credit card number
* cc_exp **required**, *MM/YYYY* expiration date
* cc_cvc **required**, valid CVC number from back of card
* campaign -or- opportunity **required**, *string*, unique identifier for the parent campaign or opportunity
* donation_date timestamp, *YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS*, time of donation
* first_name **required**, *string*, donor first name
* last_name **required**, *string*, donor last name
* billing_address1 **required**, *string*, billing address
* billing_city **required**, *string*, billing city
* billing_state **required**, *string*, state
* billing_postal_code **required**, *string*, billing postal code
* billing_country **required**, *string*, billing country
* donation_total **required**, *signed int*, donation amount. **donation amount must be 5 or the campaign donation miniumum amount, whichever is greater
* donation_level **string**, this represents the label of a donation level
* contact **required**, boolean, true/false, default false, used to define if donor opted out of being contacted by email
* email_address **required**, string, email address of donor

### Credit Card Processing Requirements
1. You MUST host your custom checkout page under SSL
2. You need to include our Checkout Javascript and pass your Public API Key (available in Account Settings in the Dashboard).
3. Form input name for your Credit Card Number, Expiration Date, and CVC number must be set to what is showcased in the form example below.
4. Expiration data must be in the form of MM/YYYY


### How it works

**Preliminary Credit Card Processing**

1. Collect the donation and billing information.
2. Pass the credit card information to Giving Impact’s checkout javascript method that coordinates with Stripe to make sure required credit card data is provided and appears valid. If it passes basic validation then Stripe provides a payment token in return.

**Donation and Full Credit Card Processing**

1. Post the donation, billing, and Stripe’s payment token to the /donations API method.
2. If the credit card or any Giving Impact data fails validation for any reason, the API will return an appropriate error.
3. If successful, then the donation is saved and full donation data is returned.

###Preliminary Credit Card Processing Requirements/Approach
* You MUST host your custom checkout page under SSL
* You need to include our Checkout Javascript and pass your Giving Impact Public API Key (available in Account Settings in the Dashboard).
* Form input name for your Credit Card Number, Expiration Date, and CVC number must be set to what is showcased in the example below.
* Expiration data must be in the form of MM/YYYY
*)We’re big fans of Stripe’s [jQuery.payments library](https://stripe.com/blog/jquery-payment) to help improve your credit card forms.

This approach checks that credit card data is well formed, communicates when it is not, and creates a Stripe payment token when it is. This token is what is posted along with other required data to our API and helps to ensure that credit card data never hits your server, let alone ours. The token has all the necessary data encrypted within it for Stripe to read and process.

The code example below details the bullets above.


## Donation Form Example

    <?php 
    
    require_once "givingimpact-php/MODL/GivingImpact.php";

    use MODL\GivingImpact as GIAPI;

    $api = new GIAPI('MY-APPLICATION-NAME','MY_PRIVATE_KEY');
    $campaign $api->campaign->fetch ('CAMPAIGN_OR_OPPORTUNITY_TOKEN');

    // check for a POST object
    if ($_POST) {  
      $_POST = $p;
      $donation = $campaign->donation;
      $donation->donation_total = $p[$amount];
      $donation->first_name = $p[first_name];
      $donation->last_name            = $p['last_name'];
      $donation->contact              = $p['fields'];
      $donation->billing_address1     = $p['fields'];
      $donation->billing_city         = $p['fields'];
      $donation->billing_state        = $p['fields'];
      $donation->billing_postal_code  = $p['fields'];
      $donation->billing_country      = 'USA';
      $donation->email_address        = $p['fields'];
      $donation->card                 = $p['token'];

      $donation->custom_responses     = $p['fields'];


      $response = $donation->create();

      if( !$response->isError ) {
          //go to your success template
          header('Location: ./complete.php');
      } else {
          //failure template
          header('Location: ./error.php');
      }

      exit;

    }
